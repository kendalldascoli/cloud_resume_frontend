# Cloud Resume Challenge - Frontend Repository

The GitHub Frontend Repository is a crucial part of the Cloud Resume Challenge, serving multiple purposes to support the websiteâ€™s functionality, design, and deployment.

## Key Benefits

1. **Centralized Source for Website Code**
   - The frontend repository is the primary storage for all website files, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These files define the look and feel of the website, creating the outward-facing aesthetics that users interact with.

2. **Visitor Counter Integration**
   - A core component of the challenge is displaying a visitor counter on the site. This repository includes the JavaScript code needed to call the backend API and display the real-time visitor count. This integration demonstrates connectivity between the frontend and backend services, a key skill in cloud and web development.

3. **Automated Deployment via CI/CD**
   - The frontend repository is integrated with CI/CD pipelines, such as GitHub Actions, to automate deployment. When changes are pushed to the repository, the CI/CD workflow deploys the updated site to AWS S3, ensuring that the live website always reflects the latest version.
   - This automated deployment emphasizes DevOps practices, ensuring the project is reliable and continuously updated.

## Summary

The GitHub Frontend Repository is essential for:
- Centralizing the website code
- Integrating dynamic features like the visitor counter
- Automating deployments through CI/CD workflows

This repository is a foundational part of the Cloud Resume Challenge, supporting an efficient, professional development process and demonstrating cloud and DevOps skills.
